# Unibrew

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.
It is a multilanguage communication platform that allows to minimise the interpersonal contact between truck drivers arriving at Faxe Brewery and the administration office employees. Through reduction of communication noise truck drivers can more efficiently fill out the delivery form.

Designed using Figma and developed with Angular 2+, Firebase and Material Design.
